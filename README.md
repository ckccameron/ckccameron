- **Why did I transition into software development?...**
   - *I have eager curiosity for how software can positively transform & I want to contribute to impactful projects.*
   - *I enjoy the gradual ascension of learning, progressing & continuing to challenge myself in the work I do.*
   - *Software development merges problem-solving with creativity in a way that opens up my angles of approach & the ways I find solutions.*
   - *My passion for sports & music connects to software because intuitiveness & the inclination to ask "how" & "why" fuels the purpose I find in my work.*
